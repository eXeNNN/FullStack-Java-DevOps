            <p class="ntext">If you want to work with us, there are some requesites:<br><br>
                1- First of all you must be a minion to work here to create the best environment possible. If you are not a minion, we request you to not to try to send the form.<br><br>
                2- Second, you need to know that we don't have a lot of money...so you may not receive the salary that you think you deserve. So if you are willing to get rich working here...this is not your place.<br><br>
                3- Third and last one, this is a fictional company that can't offer any kind of job because we are not real but if you want to send the form anyway, feel free to do it :)
            </p>
            <p class="ntext">The form you need to fill is in the Contact section. Just write "Job Application" in the subject.<br><br>
                Thank you for your interest in this company :D
            </p>
